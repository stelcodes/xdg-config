# Installing via Flatpak
Flatpak version has peripheral-joystick add-on installed by default and works just fine.
```
flatpak install flathub tv.kodi.Kodi
flatpak run tv.kodi.Kodi
```

# Controller for Menu Navigation
To get controller working, go to Settings -> System -> Inputs, and then click the controller buttons on the default layout to map them to Kodi's menu buttons.

# Naming Media Files
[Naming video files](https://kodi.wiki/view/Naming_video_files)

[TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/) is the default metadata scraper for all movies and shows. Make sure the names of the files match up with their names and years.

# Adding Media Sources
For some reason the default search provider (The Movie Database Python) doesn't work so switch to the other one when adding sources (The one without Python in the name).

# Games
Game support via retroarch seems super shoddy as of spring 2022 so don't even bother. Just use RetroArch for games.
