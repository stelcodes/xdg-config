Make sure to change firewall rules
Fedora:
```
firewall-cmd --add-service=syncthing --permanent
firewall-cmd --reload
```
Add systemd user service file in .config, then
```
systemctl --user enable syncthing
```

Then connect to the new computer from previous syncthing nodes,
and share the previous folders with new node.
