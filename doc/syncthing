Make sure to change firewall rules
Fedora:
sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-service=syncthing --permanent
sudo firewall-cmd --reload

Add systemd user service file in .config, then
systemctl --user enable syncthing

Then connect to the new computer from previous syncthing nodes,
and share the previous folders with new node.
